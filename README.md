Sports E-commerce SPA

Description
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for an e-commerce website selling sportswear and gear. The website allows users to browse through a variety of products, add items to their cart, remove items from the cart, and leave reviews for the products. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON Server as a mock backend to simulate an e-commerce experience.

Features:
Browse Products: Users can view various sportswear and gear items available for sale.
Add to Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
Remove from Cart: Users can remove products from their cart.
Leave Reviews: Users can leave reviews on the products they purchased.
Mock Database: The products and reviews are served from a db.json file using JSON Server.
Technologies Used:
HTML: The structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling the page to make it responsive and attractive.
JavaScript: Handling dynamic content, event listeners, and interactions.
JSON Server: A fake REST API to serve product and review data.
Git: For version control and deployment.
